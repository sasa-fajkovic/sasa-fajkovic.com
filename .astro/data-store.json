Then you allow the bot to merge if all required checks have passed (linting, building the project, running tests, licenses scanning, etc.).\n\nSince the bot can create and update pull requests any time of any day, you embrace the concept of \"letting it go wild\" and that you will have new commits to main branch done **without any human intervention or control**. \n\nThis sounds scary but give it a try.

Have you ever heard any engineer say something like\n> I am very exicted to spend a week migrating all dependencies to a newer version, just to do it again next week? Safe to say, you didn't.\n\n# Legacy projects\n\nYou know how software engineers always want to work on greenfield projects and complain about legacy projects? But who are the people creating those legacy projects? \nIt's those same software engineers. We (software engineers) are the ones creating the mess we're complaining about. It's not the PM/PO, not the CTO/CEO/COO, not the auditors... it's us!\n\nYet, when the next interview comes around, most will complain to talent-aquisition/recruiters how they don't want to work on legacy projects. \n\nThis is just running away from your own responsibilities. You just don't have the strength to admit that you don't want to deal with the mess you created, and the easiest way is to \"abandon ship\" while complaining how things are slow, chaotic and unmaintained.\n\nOne very, very, very common cause of legacy projects is dependency management and dealing with obsolete libraries.\n\n# Dependency management\n\nMore often than not, upgrading dependencies doesn't bring any direct business impact to your project. We want to work on projects, delivering solutions to interesting and complex problems. We want to make some meaningful work and have an impact. \n\nWe do not want to go through changelogs of all libraries, upgrade `libA` from version `1.2.3` to `1.2.4` and repeat this over and over again. This is not interesting, fun nor impactfull work.\n\nSo what if we can do a bit of magic to resolve **MOST** of these boring tasks in a good old fashion... by not doing them at all.\n\nBut hey, this means creating legacy, unmaintained projects, right? **NO!**\nJust because we, software engineers won't do it, doesn't mean it won't get done.\n\n---\n\n# Setup\n\nHere we will define some basic rules to ensure safe delivery, yet enabling us to have fully automated dependency upgrades. The concept of [unsupervised CI/CD](https://sasa-fajkovic.com/2025-02-16-unsupervised-cicd/) was described in [this blog post](https://sasa-fajkovic.com/2025-02-16-unsupervised-cicd/).\n\n## Phase 1 - dependency management bot\n\n- Utilize tools for automatic dependency management like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to have scheduled and frequent creation of pull requests to upgrade dependencies.\n\n- Enable Renovate to auto-merge pull requests.\n\n## Phase 2 - repository setup\n\n- Your repository must have one or more required checks to pass. *Example - tests must pass before you can merge a PR. If the tests fail, you must not be able to merge a PR.*\n\n- Ensure a PR can be merged ONLY when the pr-branch is up to date with the base branch. *GitHub example: turn on `Require branches to be up to date before merging`*\n\n## Phase 3 - CI pipeline\n\n- Ensure your CI pipeline and your tests are good enought that you trust them. \n\n- Your pipeline should have **at minimum** a job like `Validate change` which builds the project and runs the tests. The `Validate change` job must be green/sucessful ONLY if the build and test steps do not fail.\n\n- Add a second job called `Call AI agent` which depends on the `Validate change` job and is executed only when:\n  - the author of the pull request is Renovate **AND** \n  - only if the `Validate change` job has failed.\n\n**Pro tip:** Ensure to post a comment on a pull request, or at least add a label to a pull request. These will be used as flags if an AI agent was already invoked or not for this pull request. If the AI agent was already invoked, do not invoke the AI agent again for this pull request.\n\n# Result\n\n## Simplified visualisation\n\n- PR Created -> Test pass -> auto merge ✅\n- PR Created - Tests fail -> Call AI agent -> auto merge if fixed ✅\n- PR Created - Tests fail -> Call AI agent -> revert changes if not fixed ❌\n\n## Additional pro-tips\n\n- Revert AI agent changes - If an AI agent wasn't able to fix the PR, you should probably revert the changes to reduce noise.
